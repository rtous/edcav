# Setup your computer for the DRCAV hands-on and lab assignments

DRCAV lab assignments are designed to work on Linux (Ubuntu). They will work for macOS too, with minor changes.

## If you have Windows 10 (Home or any other edition)

a. [WSL2](./wsl.md) may be a very practical way.

b. A [virtual machine](./virtualmachine.md) may be not so practical but it will provide a more similar environment. 

## (optional) Docker

Independently of your operating system, you may try using Docker containers for the DRCAV labs as explained [here](./docker.md).
