As we reflect on the accomplishments of the Apollo program, NASA is preparing to make the next giant leap to venture even further into space. The new Space Launch System and the Orion spacecraft will enable astronauts to capture an asteroid and bring it into orbit around the moon, thus enabling scientific investigations of the origins of our solar system.

The Lunar Module, nicknamed Eagle and flown by Neil Armstrong and Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin, touched down near the southern rim of the Sea of Tranquility, one of the large, dark basins that contribute to the Man in the Moon visible from Earth. Armstrong and Aldrin spent about two hours outside the LM setting up experiments and collecting samples. At one point, Armstrong ventured east of the LM to examine a small crater, dubbed Little West, that he'd flown over just before landing.  The trails of disturbed regolith created by the astronauts' boots are still clearly visible in photographs of the landing site taken by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) narrow-angle camera (LROC) more than four decades later.  LROC imagery makes it possible to visit the landing site in a whole new way by flying around a three-dimensional model of the site. LROC scientists created the digital elevation model using a stereo pair of images. Each image in the pair shows the site from a slightly different angle, allowing sophisticated software to infer the shape of the terrain, similar to the way that left and right eye views are combined in the brain to produce the perception of depth.  The animator draped an LROC photograph over the terrain model. He also added a 3D model of the LM descent stage—the real LM in the photograph looks oddly flat when viewed at an oblique angle.  Although the area around the site is relatively flat by lunar standards, West Crater (the big brother of the crater visited by Armstrong) appears in dramatic relief near the eastern edge of the terrain model. Ejecta from West comprises the boulders that Armstrong had to avoid as he searched for a safe landing site.  Apollo 11 was the first of six increasingly ambitious crewed lunar landings. The exploration of the lunar surface by the Apollo astronauts, when combined with the wealth of remote sensing data now being returned by LRO, continues to inform our understanding of our nearest neighbor in space.","media_type":"video","keywords":["Apollo 11","LRO","Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter","Moon","Landing Site"],"title":"A New Look at the Apollo 11 Landing Site","center":"HQ","date_created":"2014-07-18T00:00:00Z","nasa_id":"A New Look at the Apollo 11 Landing Site"}],"href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/video/A New Look at the Apollo 11 Landing Site/collection.json"},{"links":[{"rel":"preview","href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/video/KSC-20190716-MH-CSH01_0002-Apollo_11_50th_Gala_Broll-3226040/KSC-20190716-MH-CSH01_0002-Apollo_11_50th_Gala_Broll-3226040~thumb.jpg","render":"image"},{"rel":"captions","href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/video/KSC-20190716-MH-CSH01_0002-Apollo_11_50th_Gala_Broll-3226040/KSC-20190716-MH-CSH01_0002-Apollo_11_50th_Gala_Broll-3226040.vtt"}],"data":[{"location":"Saturn V Building","photographer":"NASA/Cory Huston","media_type":"video","keywords":["Apollo 11","50th Anniversary","Gala","Saturn V"],"title":"Apollo 11 50th Gala - Broll","center":"KSC","date_created":"2019-07-16T00:00:00Z","description":"Apollo 11 50th Gala","nasa_id":"KSC-20190716-MH-CSH01_0002-Apollo_11_50th_Gala_Broll-3226040"}],"href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/video/KSC-20190716-MH-CSH01_0002-Apollo_11_50th_Gala_Broll-3226040/collection.json"},{"links":[{"rel":"preview","href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/video/Apollo 11 45th Anniversary Resource Reel/Apollo 11 45th Anniversary Resource Reel~thumb.jpg","render":"image"},{"rel":"captions","href":"https://images-assets.nasa.gov/video/Apollo 11 45th Anniversary Resource Reel/Apollo 11 45th Anniversary Resource Reel.srt"}],"data":[{"description":"NASA marks the 45th anniversary of the first moon landing this month while it takes the steps needed for America's next giant leap to send astronauts to Mars.
